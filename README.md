This application showcases two elegant projects that I have built as part of the Tech Talent Pipeline program.

The first project is a Blog app which records responses from users and displays a list of titles of all the reviews. If the user
clicks on the title, the app will retrieve data from the database and display the result (full review) in a separate page.

The second project is JukeBox application which already has few audios from NASA in a ready to play mode. The user can type 
the name of the audio provided in a list. If the user wishes, he/she can insert a number and the application will use the
spotify API to fetch a music for him/her. There are custom-built play, push and stop button. User can also shuffle for a random
music. There are functionalities to go to the next audio or the previous one. A feature has been added to display the upcoming
audio and the audio that was played before the current one.
